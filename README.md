# Unlimited Power
## ES6 Generators

These are all the code samples written for my talk Unlimited Power for JSConf China 2015. Most of them run out of the box with iojs 2.3 but a few do require some additional help from babel. Some don't run at all due to being incomplete or using unfinished specs.

License is MIT. Do what you please with them. If you find errors, please file issues or make pull requests.

Slides will eventually be posted [on my SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/btholt/unlimited-power-es6-generators).
